            //Two problems that regression algorithms can be used to solve is GPA prediction and stock price forecasting. For GPA prediction, factors such 
            //study hours, attendance and past academic performance helps regression algorithms can forecast a student's GPA. For stock price forecasting, 
            //factors such as market indexes, trading volumes, and historical stock prices helps regression algorithms predict the stock prices.

            //Question1 1.2
            //Two problems that belong to classification problem is fraud detention and image object recogntion. In image object recognition,
            //classification is utilized to categorize images into predefined classes based on the objects present, such as identifying animals like cats,
            //dogs, or birds. Additionally, in fraud detection, classification is employed to categorize transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent by
            //considering features like transaction amount, location, and frequency, aiding in the identification of potential fraudulent activities.

            //Question 1.3
            //Credit approval and disease diagnosis are two problems that can be solved by clustering algorithms. In credit approval, clustering involves
            //grouping individuals with similar financial profiles to assess their likelihood of credit approval. For disease diagnosis, clustering categorizes
            //patients based on health metrics, aiding in the identification of patterns associated with specific medical conditions. Both applications leverage
            //clustering algorithms to make informed decisions in their respective domains.

            //Question 1.4
            //Anomaly detection finds unusual patterns in data, useful for fraud detection and security.

            //Question 1.5
            //In a weather app, the ML.NET pipeline loads data, preprocesses it, engineers features, trains a model, assesses it, and deploys it to predict
            //future weather conditions.
